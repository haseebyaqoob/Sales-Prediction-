# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to predict future sales based on advertising expenditure across different platforms (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The dataset contains information on advertising budgets and corresponding sales figures.

## Project Overview

Sales prediction is a critical task for product and service-based businesses. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict sales based on factors such as the amount of money spent on advertising in various platforms. We will utilize **Linear Regression** to model the relationship between advertising spend and sales.


## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models
